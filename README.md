# JavaScript Quiz/Questionnaire Application 
Continuing from my JavaScript Calculator app. I wanted to start small and to not over complicate the learning process.

# Project Context
After learning & utilizing the basics of JavaScript, the Syntax, Variables, Operator and Functions from my Calculator app. I wanted to exspand my knowledge to array data structures:

1. Storing multiple objects in an array.
2. Allocating multiple information into each object.
3. Retrieving each object and the data.
4. Allocating the data information into multiple variables.
5. Displaying the variables data by HTML DOM manipulation. 

# My Objective
To understand array data structures. From creating an arrary, storing objects with infomation within it into an array. And how to retrieve each object and display the information.

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot building this application. But mainly from the use of connecting the back-end calculation class and displaying the results of process to the user.

1. Creating an Array.
2. Creating objects with multiple infomation within them.
3. Having a correct answer within each object.
4. Retrieving each data information into variables.
5. Creating a multiple choice display.
6. Answer verification and diplaying the number of correct answers.  

# Personal Improvements
Although the Quiz/Questionnaire application executes on it original objective. I would like build a more realistic real-world application.
