# JavaScript Quiz/Questionnaire Application 
Continuing from my JavaScript Calculator app. I wanted to start small and to not over complicate the learning process.

# Project Context
After learning & utilizing the basics of JavaScript, the Syntax, Variables, Operator and Functions from my Calculator app. I wanted to exspand my knowledge to array data structures:

1. Storing multiple objects in an array.
2. Allocating multiple information into each object.
3. Retrieving each object and the data.
4. Allocating the data information into multiple variables.
5. Displaying the variables data by HTML DOM manipulation. 

# My Objective
To understand array data structures. From creating an arrary, storing objects with infomation within it into an array. And how to retrieve each object and display the information. 

# Lessons Learned
I learned a lot building this application. But mainly from the use of connecting the back-end calculation class and displaying the results of process to the user.

1. Creating a DarkMode theme in CSS and toggling the theme on/off.
2. Utilizing an if statement to verify if the darkMode theme if active or not. And if the theme is active manipulate the HTML DOM by changing the darkMode theme icon to another icon.
3. Utilizing an event listener when a button as been clicked and then executing a operation afterwards.
4. Having a global variable to execute functions. (Example: calculator.updateDisplay()).

# Personal Improvements
Although the calculator application executes on it original objective. I would like to further understand javascript language by building a more realistic real-world application or functionality.

# Deployment
Deployed with GitHub pages. (Near Future)
